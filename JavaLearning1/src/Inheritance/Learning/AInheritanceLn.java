	/*
	 * 1.Reuse the existing code
	 * Terminologies
	 * Sub class/Child class/ > Class who inherits the parent class
	 * Superclass/Parent class > Class which is inherited
	 * 
	 * B > A
	 * B can access all the methods and variables from Class A
	 * A cannot access any methods or variables from Class A
	 * Extends to establish a relationship
	 * Is-A Relationship
	 * Student > Person
	 * Car > Vehicle
	 * Dog > Animal
	 * Cricket > Sport
	 * 
	 * Advantage:
	 * Code Reuseability
	 * Duplicate code is controlled
	 * Extensibility
	 * Maintenance
	 *
	 *If you dont want to allow the class to get inherited declate the class as final
	 *like: public final class BasicCalculator
	 *
	 *Every class in java internal inherits object class
	 *If you are extending a class your class will not extend object class instead your parent class will inherit object class
	 *
	 *C >object
	 *C > B >object
	 *
	 *A class can extend/inherit only one class at a time
